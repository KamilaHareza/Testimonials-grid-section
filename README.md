## My process

### Built with
- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
This project helped me understand the usage of CSS Grid, especially with different screen sizes. I could use media queries to make sure that the page will present nicely on every device. The tricky part for me was figuring out what to do with a quote image, so it won't cover any text in the first card.


### Continued development
I want to start incorporating Java Script and work on understanding CSS pseudo-elements in my future projects, to become comfortable with them. Because I enjoyed working with CSS Grid in this project, I hope to use it again while creating a more complex landing pages.
